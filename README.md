A convolutional neural network for image classification. 
Feel free to use it as you please, though copying my work will be of no benefit to your learning.
The training and testing images were not mine to distribute so have been excluded, though for reproduction
purposes, they can be replaced with your own. A special thanks to Yiming Peng and Bing Xue of 
Victoria University of Wellington for suppling an initial template to work from.
